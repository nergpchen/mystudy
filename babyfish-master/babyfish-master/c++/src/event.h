/*
 * This tiny library supports the functionalities that are very similar
 * with the "delegate" and event" of .NET framework.
 * 
 * Its first version is designed too early(2004, when I was a student) so that it 
 * doesn't support the lambda of C+11, comparing with the first version, 
 * this version does not have big enhancement because time is not enough.
 * Maybe lambda will be supported in the future.
