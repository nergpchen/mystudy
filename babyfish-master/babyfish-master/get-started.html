                    Let's call the oracle host name <span class="variable">${oracle-host}</span>. 
                    It should be localhost(or 127.0.0.1) if the oracle is installed on the same machine.

                <li>
                    Let's call the oracle port number <span class="variable">${oracle-port}</span>.

            <h1>Attention please</h1>
            <p>
                Before taste this framework, please pay attention to the following two points. 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In the directory "<span class="variable">${babyfish-dir}</span>/install", 
                    there are many "bat" files and "sh" files.
                    All of them should be executed under its own directory.
                    <div>
                        Illegal example:
                        <div class="code wrong-code">
                            <pre><span class="variable">${babyfish-dir}</span>/install/babyfish/install.sh</pre>
                        </div>
                        Concurrent example:
                        <div class="code">
                            <pre>cd <span class="variable">${babyfish-dir}</span>/install/babyfish
./install.sh</pre>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Though the shell file "<span class="variable">${babyfish-dir}</span>/install/ojdbc/install.sh"
                    will not be executed by the user directly; but it's depended by other shell files.
                    In order to make other shell files can be executed successfully, plase execute 
                    <div class="code">
                        <pre>chmod +x <span class="variable">${babyfish-dir}</span>/install/ojdbc/install.sh</pre>
                    </div>
                    before execute other shells files 
                    if the current linux account does not have the execution permission of that file.
                </li>
            </ol>

                        Maybe sometimes some test cases can't be passed under Eclipse JUnit runner,
                        that's because some projects use the maven plugin(ant task) to do some 
                        byte-code instrument work in compilation-time so that the final byte-code 
                        is not the simple compilation result of java soruce file but Eclipse may 
                        do some default compliation when these projects are imported. If this problem
                        happen, use maven to recompile the project that reports error, then the test
                        cases can be passed by Eclipse IDE.

                    <h3>Step-I: Start the database server</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are two ways to run war3shop, standalone hsqldb server or Oracle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oracle is suggested because babyfish supports a functionality named 
                        <a href="doc/distinct-limit-query/index.xhtml" target="_blank">DistincitLimitQuery</a>
                        that can markedly optimize the peformance when the database is Oracle,
                        but hsqldb standalone server is another choice if there is no Oracle server.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            In order to start the hsqldb server, please use this script:                            <div class="code">
