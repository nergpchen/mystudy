queryPathsCanNotBeApplyToNonQuery                               = The query "{0}" can not use query paths because it is not select statement
hqlMustContainsSelectCaluseWhenThereIsNoFetchJoinInQueryPaths   = The query "{0}" must contains a select clause implicitly when there is some no fetch joins in the querypaths
operationRequiresQuery                                          = Can not execute the operation "{0}" because it is not select selection
illegalSubPathAlias                                             = The can not apply the query path, because the alias "{0}" or  "{1}" is not existing in the query "{2}"
hibernateLimitInMemoryForCollectionFetchIsNotEnabled            = The firstResult/maxResults are specified with collection fetch of the query whose QueryType is DISTINCT, this is not allowed! You have two choices: (1) Use the dialect class that implements interface "{0}" (for example: {1}) to be your dialect, this is the high performance solution that is consumingly recommended by babyfish, but it can not work with any database; (2) Set the property "{2}" to be "true" in the hibernate configuration or JPA configuration to allow hibernate to query all the data and then do the limit work in memory, but this is a low performance solution
scalarFetchCanOnlyBeAppliedOnJAPObjectModel                     = The query path contains some scalar property fetch path but the entity class "{0}" dose not use ObjectModel4JPA
unlimitedCountIsUnsupportedBecauseOfGroupBy                     = Can not get the unlimited count of original hql "{0}" because it has "group by"
unlimitedCountIsUnsupportedBecauseOfTooManySelections           = Can not get the unlimited count of original hql "{0}" because it has two many selections
unlimitedCountIsUnsupportedBecauseSelectionIsNotRootEntity      = Can not get the unlimited count of original hql "{0}" because it does not select the root entity
unlimitedCountIsUnsupportedBecauseOfTooManyRangeAndNoSelection  = Can not get the unlimited count of original hql "{0}" because it does not specify the selection implicitly but it contains several root entities
unlimitedCountIsUnsupportedBecauseOfNonFetchJoinsAndNoSelection = Can not get the unlimited count of original hql "{0}" because it does not specify the selection implicitly but it contains some joins without fetch behavior
