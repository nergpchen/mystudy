mustSupportDefaultConstructor               = The class "{0}" must support a constructor without parameters(Both public and non-public are OK)
eachElementOfReturnValueCanOnlyBeInterface  = Illegal behavior of class "{0}", each element of the return value of method "{1}()" must be interface type
noInterfaces                                = Illegal behavior of class "{0}", both the interfaces of the wrapped raw type and the return value of method "onGetInterfaces()" are empty so that it is possible to decide which interfaces should be implemented by the result class
canNotInvokeRawMethod                       = Illegal behavior of class "{0}", can not invoke the the methods that match any one of "{1}" from the wrapped raw object because all the interfaces of the wrapped raw object "{2}" do not support any one of them  
resultClassMustSupportDefaultConstructor    = Illegal behavior of class "{0}", the result class "{1}" that is generated at runtime must support a constructor without parameters
defaultConstructorOfResultClassMustBePublic = Illegal behavior of class "{0}", the constructor of the result class "{1}" that is generated at runtime must be public
