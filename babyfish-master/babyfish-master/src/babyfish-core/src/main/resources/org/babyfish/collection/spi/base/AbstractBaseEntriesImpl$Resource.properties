constructorRequiresRootBaseEntries              = This constructor "{0}({1})" requires the current object must be root base entries, that means the method "getParent()" must not be overridden or it must return null

initMAOwnerCanOnlyBeInvokedByRootBaseEntries    = The method "initMAOwner(ModificationAware)" can only be invoked by root base entries
initMAOwnerCanOnlyBeInvokedOnce                 = The method "initMAOwner(ModificationAware)" can only be invoked once.
putAllIsNotSupportedForTransientValueEntries    = The method "putAll(Map)" can not be invoked by the base entries that implemented "{0}"
