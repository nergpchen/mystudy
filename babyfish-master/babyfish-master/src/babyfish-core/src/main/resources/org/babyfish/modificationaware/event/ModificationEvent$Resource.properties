invalidDeclaringClassOfFactory          = The type "{0}" that is the declaring type of the factory type "{1}" is not valid, it must be a derived class of "{2}".
eventMustBeTopLevelOrStaticClass        = The modification event type "{0}" must be top-level class or static class.
invalidEventConstructorAcc              = The constructor "{0}" is invalid because the constructor of modification event must not be private.
invalidEventConstructorSignature        = The constructor "{0}" is invalid because the parameters of the constructor of modification event must be ({1}), {{1}, {2}) or ({1}, {3}).
invalidEventField                       = The field "{0}" must be deleted because the modification event need not any fields.
invalidEventMethodModifiers             = The non-static method "{0}" is invalid because the modification event's non-static methods must be public and abstract.
invalidEventMethodTypeParameters        = The non-static method "{0}" is invalid because the modification event's non-static methods must contain no type parameters.
invalidEventMethodReturnType            = The non-static method "{0}" is invalid because the modification event's property must not return void class.

invalidEventMethodNameForBoolean        = The non-static method "{0}" is invalid because the modification event's property name must start with "is" or "get" but can not equal to "is" or "get" when the property type is boolean
invalidEventMethodNameForNonBoolean     = The non-static method "{0}" is invalid because the modification event's property name must start with "get" but can not equal to "get" when property type is not boolean
invalidEventMethodThrows                = The non-static method "{0}" is invalid because it throws "{1}" and that exception is checked exception which is not allowed in the modification event.
invalidEventMethodForShared             = The non-static method "{0}" is invalid because the annotation of the class indicates it is a shared property so that it should have no parameters.
invalidEventMethodForNonShared          = The non-static method "{0}" is invalid because the annotation of the class indicates it is a non-shared property so that it should have a parameter whose type is "{1}".
missEventMethod                         = The type "{0}" must contain a method to declare the property "{1}" which is declared by the annotation.
invalidFactoryTypeParameterCount        = The factory interface "{0}" must contain {1} type parameter(s) because its declaring class "{2}" has declared {1} parameter(s).
invalidFactoryTypeParameter             = The factory interface "{0}"'s type parameters[{1}] is invalid because its name or its bounds is not same with the type parameters[{1}] of "{2}"
invalidFactoryMethodName                = The method "{0}" is invalid because its name is not "createDetachEvent", "createAttachEvent", "createReplaceEvent" or "bubbleEvent".
invalidFactoryMethodTypeParameters      = The method "{0}" is invalid because the modification event's factory methods must contain no type parameters.
invalidFactoryMethodSignature           = The signature of the method "{0}" is not expected, its signature should be "{1}".
invalidDispatchReturnType               = The dispatch method "{0}" is not excepted, its generic return type must be "{1}"
parameterMustBeSameType                 = The type of these parameters "{0}" must be same
atLeastOneParameterMustNotBeNull        = There must be at least one non-null value of these parameters "{0}"
invalidSuperConstructorInvocation       = The modification event class "{0}" is invalid, its constructor whose parameter types is "{1}" used the arguments that are not supported by the parameters to invoked the consturctor of super constructor
